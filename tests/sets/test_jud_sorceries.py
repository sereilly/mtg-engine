"""Judgment sorceries.

Opened on `main` before the wave-1 fan-out with one marked section per
group. **A group writes only between its own markers and puts its imports
at the top of its own section**, never at the top of the file: a
self-contained section cannot lose an import to a merge, can be moved whole
when the file nears its size cap, and parallel branches editing disjoint
regions merge without a conflict. Every module-level helper, constant and
import alias in a section carries that group's `_w<wave>g<n>_` prefix — the
sections share one module namespace.

Cards come from `set_pool("JUD")` / `set_cards("JUD")` — never a new
`conftest.py` fixture and never a spelled-out `cards/*.json` path
(`tests/sets/README.md`). Drain the stack with `tests.helpers.resolve_stack`,
never a bare `while game.stack:` loop — that spins forever once a seat is
owed a prompt. A test asserts what a game showed (boards, zones, life, the
log), not instruction kinds alone.
