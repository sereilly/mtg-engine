"""Per-card tests for Visions' sorceries.

See tests/sets/README.md for the convention: get cards through
``set_pool("VIS")`` / ``set_cards("VIS")``, never a spelled-out
``cards/*.json`` path and never a new conftest fixture.

**Parallel-authorship convention for this set.** Wave 1 splits by grammar
family rather than by printed type, so several groups land tests in this one
file. Each group appends a single delimited block::

    # --- W<wave>G<n>: <topic> ---

and puts **its own imports at the top of its own block**, not in a shared
header. A branch that added an import to a shared header loses it in the
mechanical "take ours, append the branch's block" merge — a ``NameError`` at
collection, found only after the merge is committed. A self-contained block
cannot lose one.

Do not edit the text above this paragraph, and do not edit an earlier group's
block.
