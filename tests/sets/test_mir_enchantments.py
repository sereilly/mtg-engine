"""Per-card tests for Mirage's enchantments.

See tests/sets/README.md for the convention: get cards through
``set_pool("MIR")`` / ``set_cards("MIR")``, never a spelled-out
``cards/*.json`` path and never a new conftest fixture.

Organised as a sequence of self-contained round sections, each headed
``# --- Round N: <topic> ---`` and written up in ROADMAP.md under the round
that bought its cards.

**Parallel-authorship convention for this set.** Wave 1 splits by grammar
family rather than by printed type, so several groups land tests in this one
file. Each group appends a single delimited block::

    # --- W<wave>G<n>: <topic> ---

and puts **its own imports at the top of its own block**, not in a shared
header. That is deliberate. The mechanical merge for this file is "take ours,
append the branch's block", and a branch that added an import to a shared header
loses it in exactly that move — a ``NameError`` at collection, found only after
the merge is committed. A self-contained block cannot lose one.

Do not edit the text above this paragraph, and do not edit an earlier group's
block. The integrator compares every branch's copy of this header against the
merge base byte for byte; a branch that changed it is a branch whose block
cannot be appended mechanically.

    flanking as a triggered ability the compiler builds out of a printed line,

    flanker's filter while giving it no ability at all. The grant is therefore a
    grant of the line, and the word comes back because layer 6 seeds itself from
    the compiled keyword lines.
