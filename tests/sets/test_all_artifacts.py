"""Per-card tests for Alliances' artifacts.

See tests/sets/README.md for the convention: get cards through
``set_pool("ALL")`` / ``set_cards("ALL")``, never a spelled-out
``cards/*.json`` path and never a new conftest fixture.

**Parallel-authorship convention for this set.** The waves that implement
Alliances split by grammar family rather than by printed type, so several
groups land tests in this one file. Each group appends a single delimited
block::

    # --- W<wave>G<n>: <topic> ---

and puts **its own imports at the top of its own block**, not in a shared
header. That is deliberate. The mechanical merge for this file is "take ours,
append the branch's block", and a branch that added an import to a shared
header loses it in exactly that move -- a ``NameError`` at collection, found
only after the merge is committed. A self-contained block cannot lose one.

Do not edit the text above. The integrator compares every branch's copy of this
header against the merge base byte for byte; a branch that changed it is a
branch whose block cannot be appended mechanically.

# --- W1G1: the land-family artifacts ---
"""Mishra's Groundbreaker and Storm Cauldron.

Both are artifacts about *lands*, and each needed a piece the pool had never
printed: an animation with no duration at all (CR 611.2a -- "if no duration is
stated, it lasts until the end of the game"), and a land-play permission that
names every seat rather than the source's controller (CR 305.2).

Storm Cauldron's second line is the one worth watching. It compiles a real
instruction and is carried out *inline* at the tap-for-mana seam rather than on
the stack, because a land is tapped part-way through paying a cost (CR 601.2g)
and there is no stack to enqueue onto yet -- the same arrangement Manabarbs'
damage has. So the assertions below are behavioural: the mana arrives, and then
the land does not.
