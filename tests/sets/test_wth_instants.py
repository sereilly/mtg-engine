"""Weatherlight instants.

Opened on `main` before the wave-1 fan-out, per SET_PLAYBOOK.md's block
convention: **every group appends a delimited block and puts its own imports at
the top of that block**, never at the top of the file. A self-contained block
cannot lose an import to a mechanical union, and every group's first write is an
append rather than a file-creation collision.
