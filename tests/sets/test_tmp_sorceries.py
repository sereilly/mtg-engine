"""Tempest sorceries.

Opened on `main` before the wave-1 fan-out, per SET_PLAYBOOK.md's block
convention: **every group appends a delimited block and puts its own imports at
the top of that block**, never at the top of the file. A self-contained block
cannot lose an import to a mechanical union, and every group's first write is an
append rather than a file-creation collision.

    # --- W1G1: shadow (CR 702.28) ---
    from engine import Game, PlayerState
    ...

Cards come from `set_pool("TMP")` / `set_cards("TMP")` — never a new
`conftest.py` fixture and never a spelled-out `cards/*.json` path
(`tests/sets/README.md`).
