"""What an Aura's effect lines say, and whether the engine implements them.

The compiler classified every Aura as supported on the strength of a single
whitelist substring — ``"enchant creature"``. An Aura reading "Enchanted
creature glimmers uncontrollably", or one with no effect line at all, compiled
as `supported`, because nothing ever looked past the enchant clause. At 44
Auras that is 44 cards whose support status was never actually checked; at the
full card pool it is thousands.

This table names the effect lines the engine carries out. The support gate
requires every non-enchant line of an Aura to match something here, so an Aura
whose effect is not implemented is reported unsupported (loud) instead of
entering play and doing nothing.

**This is classification, not dispatch.** The behaviour still lives in
``mixins/oracle_instructions.py:_apply_aura_effect`` — a 270-line text-reading
if-chain. Giving each of these entries a real ``ContinuousEffect`` owned by the
Aura is the phase-6 job, and this table is the enumeration that work needs: 52
distinct lines across 44 cards, every one appearing exactly once, which is the
signature of a mechanism that grows one branch per card.

Entries are ordered most-specific first, and each names the code that carries
it out — a line recognized here but implemented nowhere is worse than one that
fails to parse.
