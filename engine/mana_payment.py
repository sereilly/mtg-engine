"""Whether a player can pay a mana cost from what is *on the board*, and how.

There are two different questions about paying, and the engine only ever
answered one of them well. ``SpellCastingMixin._pay_mana_cost`` spends the
**pool** — the right question while casting or activating, where producing the
mana is the player's own separate action. The other question is asked by an
effect that must collect a cost with no priority window in between: "you may pay
{1}{B}. If you do, …" (Liliana's Devotee), an upkeep's "unless you pay", a
draw-step obligation. There the player never gets a chance to tap for mana, so
the payment has to look at the untapped lands as well as at the pool.

That question had one answer and it counted to a number: floating mana plus
untapped mana-producing lands, against a **generic** cost. Every printed
"you may pay" with a coloured pip in it therefore refused at compile time, which
is honest and also permanent — the lowering could not admit a cost the payer
could not collect.

**Why an exact matching rather than a greedy pick.** Assigning lands to coloured
pips one at a time gets a board wrong that can genuinely pay: a Swamp and a
Dimir dual against {U}{B} is fine, but a greedy pass that spends the dual on the
{B} strands the {U}. Guessing wrong here does not overpay — it *under*-reports,
so a cost the player could pay is never offered — and CR 601.2h's "unpayable
costs can't be paid" is about what the player is *able* to do, not about what an
approximation could find. The numbers are tiny (a handful of pips against a
handful of lands), so the exact answer is a dozen lines of augmenting-path
matching and no reason to accept a heuristic.
