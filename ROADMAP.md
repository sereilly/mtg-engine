# Scaling Roadmap

Target: grow the card pool from 388 unique cards (LEA/LEB/2ED/ARN/3ED shipped,
M21 measured at 232/285) to the full release line - **137 sets, 33,594
printings, 26,113 unique cards** per `set_progress.json`.

A chronological engineering journal, kept to the last three rounds. Everything
before them — the founding audit, the parser migration (finished:
`engine/parsing/` is deleted and `engine/grammar/` is the only parser), the
per-set narratives, and M21 rounds 1–79 — lives in git history at and before
commit `c46e6c8`. What those rounds established that outlives their narrative is
kept below under **Carried forward**. The process a set follows is
`SET_PLAYBOOK.md`.

---

## Standing invariants

Anything that weakens these is a regression regardless of what it enables:

1. **No silent wrongness.** A card may fail loudly as unsupported with a
   reason; it may never resolve as something other than what it says.
2. **The suite stays fast.** 4,454 tests at a steady 23s, against a CI budget of
   35s. The budget catches a step change; the *baseline* recorded beside it in
   `ci.yml` is what catches creep, and it is the number to keep honest — it
   went 9s → 17s across four phases with the gate green the whole way. Raising
   the budget is a decision, not maintenance.

   The baseline moved 17 → 23 in this session, and that is a *record* of growth
   rather than permission for it: ~130 tests were added (permanent ids, the
   grammar layering guards, two renumbering regression suites) and 17 stopped
   being true. Leaving it would have parked the warning threshold
   (`BASELINE × 1.5` = 25.5s) two and a half seconds away, so the next
   unrelated change would have been blamed for drift this one caused. The
   budget is untouched.

   **The variance recorded here earlier did not reproduce.** Two back-to-back
   local runs once measured 43.98s and 16.79s, which read as a runner-weather
   problem serious enough to question the mechanism; three consecutive runs
   later landed on 23s exactly. Treat one slow run as noise. The distinction
   still matters — "the budget is too tight" and "this box is noisy" have the
   same symptom and opposite fixes — but there is currently no evidence for
   either.
3. **Determinism.** A given seed reproduces a run exactly. Parsing and lowering
   are pure functions of card text.
4. **Ratchets only tighten.** Coverage floors, probe baselines, and accepted-diff
   lists shrink or hold — never grow without review. "Tighten" is the
   invariant, not "shrink": `hook_reliance_ratchet.json` holds *ceilings*, so
   tightening moves it down while `grammar_ratchet.json` tightens by moving up.
   The pair is deliberate — one guards the general reader keeping ground, the
   other guards the special-case readers not taking any — and a ceiling needs
   its measurement asserted, because unlike a floor it passes when it breaks.
5. **No card name decides behaviour outside `card_hooks.py`** — anywhere under
   `engine/`, heuristics and AI code included. The rule is about *dispatch*, not
   mention: a name in a log line, a prompt label or a fixture decklist is data;
   a name in an `if` is a claim, and `tests/engine/test_card_name_reads.py`
   enforces exactly that shape. "Only one card does this" is a claim about the
   *pool*, and it expires without anyone editing the comment — so before a name
   goes anywhere else, give an invented card the same printed text and check
   that it behaves. A name-keyed dispatch and a CR rule written as a card
   special case grep identically and have opposite fixes.

   Two things this covers that the earlier wording did not, both found by
   writing the guard rather than by reading the rule. **Heuristics are in
   scope.** A weight is tuning and stays tuning, but *which cards a weight
   reaches* is a claim about the pool and decays exactly like a parse rule —
   `ai_policy` named eight cards and aimed four unnamed removal spells at its own
   board. Derive the reach (`engine/ai_valuation.py`) and keep the weight.
   **Test oracles are out of scope, with their reason measured.**
   `ai_simulator._assert_expected` asserts a card did what the *printed* card
   says; deriving that from the compiled program makes it a tautology, and the
   only exemptions that stay are ones where the tautology has actually been
   demonstrated. An acknowledgement carries the measurement, not an opinion.

---

## Carried forward

The parts of rounds 1–52 that are about the *next* card rather than about the
round that wrote them. Everything here was established by a round now in git
history; the round number is given so the reasoning can be read in full.

### How a round is chosen

Sort the unsupported cards by **first failing clause** — `compile_line` names
the exact refusal, which beats reading the aggregate report buckets — then rank
by cards-per-change. Round 37 found **59 of 87 remaining cards blocked by
exactly one line**, at which point the question stops being "what is the biggest
mechanism" and becomes "which single line is cheapest per card". A block that
needs two rounds is worth splitting only if neither half ships a card alone
(rounds 7 + 8 did exactly that, one card each plus one together).

### Open blocks, still standing

- **The legend rule reads the printed name** (round 49, restated by every round
  since). CR 707.2 copies the name, so a Clone of Barrin is a second Barrin and
  CR 704.5j should bin one — verified, and it does not. Two reads are wrong, not
  one: `perm.card.name`, and the `Legendary` supertype, which `has_type` does
  not cover at all (round 48 exempted `game_ending.py` for exactly that). All
  eleven legendary creatures in the pool are M21, so nothing can hit this until
  the set ships — which makes it worth doing before it does. A ratchet on
  `card.name` needs its own census first: hundreds of reads are log lines.
- **Activating an ability of a card in hand.** "Discard this card:" (Waker of
  Waves) is an activation cost paid from *hand* — a mechanic with no seam in
  this engine, not a wording gap. Niambi, Subira and Sanctum of Shattered
  Heights want the same seam. Round 51 built the discard *picker* for a
  permanent's ability and left this half untouched.
- **The exiled-with linkage**: an object exiled *with* a permanent and returned
  when that permanent leaves (Kitesail Freebooter, Idol of Endurance,
  Archfiend's Vessel). The pool's only exile-until-leaves is Oubliette's, which
  phases out and is name-keyed in `card_hooks.py`; routing Freebooter through it
  buys one card at the cost of a ceiling raise, so the linkage wants deriving
  first. The shape is `cast_permissions.py`'s — a collection on `Game`, granted
  by an effect, swept when its source leaves.
- **The Shrine cycle and the where-clause cards**: see round 57's *Next* below,
  which is current.

### Recorded, measured, and not yet fixed

- **The Nine Lives class — partial implementation reported as full.** A card is
  supported when **any** line is, so a card can report supported while other
  lines produce nothing. Nine Lives' damage-prevention replacement and its exile
  trigger produce nothing. Round 53's hollow gate closes only the *fully* hollow
  case (nothing supported, nothing static, markers only), and round 20's all-of
  gate closes the modal shape; the general class is still open and has been
  found one card at a time — Return to Nature's third mode (round 12), Read the
  Tides' second (17), Garruk's Uprising' third line (34), Sanctum of Stone
  Fangs, Fiery Emancipation and Teferi's Ageless Insight (53). Two of those
  three are implemented (rounds 54 and 57) and Teferi's is still open — which
  closes three cards and not the class. It wants a census of its own, in the
  shape Phase 2 uses for a set.
- **Fabled Passage** is hollow and stays supported: a land with no mana ability
  whose only ability is unreadable, kept by the separate "a land is always at
  least playable" rule in the compiler. That rule is right for a land that taps
  for mana and wrong for one that does not, and overturning it is a decision
  with its own reasoning to write down.
- **Rock Hydra's automatic counter shield.** "For each 1 damage that would be
  dealt to it, remove a +1/+1 counter from it and prevent that 1 damage" is
  acknowledged in `IMPLEMENTED_ELSEWHERE` as `prevention.py`, but that file
  implements only his *activated* {R} shield — nothing reads counters in any
  damage path. So the automatic half is the Nine Lives class hiding behind a
  verified-sounding acknowledgement. Round 26's counter record is the
  prerequisite for fixing it honestly.
- **The verification tracker holds 19 untested cards** (the ones Revised added).
  Rounds 46–47 checked all nineteen behaviour by behaviour and fixed three real
  bugs in them, but a headless sweep is not a manual in-game pass and
  `card_verification.json` records what a human checked. A generated artifact
  that is stale does not read as stale; it reads as an answer.

### Deliberate refusals, with their reasons

Not gaps to close on sight — each was measured and left refusing:

- **Pursued Whale** — "spells your opponents cast **that target this
  creature**": a narrowing about the spell's *targets*, which no filter here
  expresses.
- **Faith's Fetters / Enthralling Hold** — "its activated abilities can't be
  activated unless they're mana abilities"; "you can't choose an untapped
  creature as this spell's target as you cast it".
- **Crypt Lurker** — an either/or action cost ("sacrifice a creature **or**
  discard a creature card") needs an or-composed cost prompt, not round 23's
  single-action one.
- **Protection past what the shields test.** Round 25 gave qualities colours,
  "multicolored", planeswalkers and creature subtypes; Feat of Resistance
  ("protection from the color of your choice" — a chosen-colour grant plus a
  layer-6 read), Runed Halo (player protection from a chosen *name*) and Feline
  Sovereign (protection as a lord-buff grant) stay out. Hexproof stays
  colour-only, because its targeting branch reads colour words alone.
- **Cost reductions that cannot be computed** — the {X} self-reductions
  (Volcanic Salvo, Chandra's Incinerator) and Sanctum of Tranquil Light's
  per-Shrine *activation* reduction. Reading an unrecognized condition as
  satisfied makes a spell cheaper than it is, and cheaper is the one direction a
  cost error must never go.
- **El-Hajjâj's "you gain that much life"** is deliberately *not* a row in
  `_EVENT_QUANTITIES`: its fire site records the amount under a different key,
  so claiming its line would retire a hook onto a handler reading the wrong
  name.
- **A durationless doubling** (a continuous effect the layers would have to own)
  and **doubling toughness** (a different effect — consuming the noun without
  checking it is how one card's production quietly claims another's).
- **Demonic Embrace's graveyard cast** — "by paying 3 life and discarding a
  card", a *cast* additional cost over the round-19 permission seam.
- **A filter with no card behind it is untested by construction** — round 43's
  sacrifice *trigger* is unnarrowed for that reason, even though the
  subject-group machinery could read a narrowing. Still standing for the
  trigger; the cost and effect halves stopped being covered by it in round 56,
  when two cards printed the narrowing.

### Idioms these rounds established

1. **A narrowed trigger condition lands on both sides of the pipeline.** The
   compiler takes a condition from `engine/oracle.py`'s regex table and the
   effect from the grammar, so a condition narrowed on one side only compiles
   the card **supported and firing on the wrong event** (rounds 7, 28, 54).
   Where a regex cannot describe the narrowing it only *delimits* the phrase — a
   named group ending in `_subject`, handed to `grammar.parse_subject_filter`,
   with a guard comparing the two over the whole pool (round 34). The same
   shape, for the same reason, wherever a *second* reader of one clause exists:
   round 56 applied it to an activation cost's "Sacrifice <noun phrase>", where
   the two readers drift towards a cost nobody pays.
2. **A restriction the dispatcher cannot test refuses at compile time.** An
   ignored restriction on a trigger is not a narrower card, it is a card firing
   on everything (`TESTABLE_SUBJECT_FILTER_KEYS`, round 34). Same rule for a
   search filter, a picker filter and a cost the charger cannot express.
3. **A fire site that enumerates instruction kinds cannot be complete** — it is
   only as complete as the last card that touched it. Onulet never gained a
   point of life across four shipped sets because its kind was not in a list
   (round 45). Fire every trigger of the shape; name genuine exceptions in a
   frozenset beside the loop.
4. **A condition can parse in both tables and have no dispatcher at all.** Four
   were found that way — `creature_attacks_or_blocks` (28),
   `creature_you_control_dies` (30), `you_gain_life` (33),
   `creature_becomes_blocked` (34). Check the dispatcher exists before believing
   a condition works.
5. **"Whenever X" goes on the one seam X passes through**, never a new fire
   site: `_draw_with_replacements` (draw), `Game._gain_life` (life gain),
   `Game.place_plus1_counters` (counters), `Game.sacrifice_permanent`
   (sacrifice), `_mark_damage_on_permanent` (damage),
   `_put_permanent_onto_battlefield` (enters). Where no seam exists, build it
   first: round 43 found thirteen sacrifices in three spellings, seven of which
   skipped ownership, tokens, replacements, Aura teardown, the death count and
   the dies-triggers.
6. **Last-known information (CR 603.10) is frozen at the fire site**, not read
   at resolution — a dead creature's counters (30), its power (31), its
   controller (32), the damage an event dealt (39). The measured exception is
   round 42: a *sacrificed source*'s P/T lives in `Permanent` metadata, which
   nothing off the battlefield touches, so it can be read at resolution.
7. **A back-reference names its producer or refuses.** "That much" parses as
   `ThatMuch(None)`; lowering resolves it against `amount_from` (this
   resolution's scratchpad) or `amount_from_trigger` (the firing event's
   captured context), which are separate keys because reading either for the
   other yields a silent zero (round 33).
8. **Stated AI policies, not special cases**: the maximum for "up to N", the
   first printed mode, the costliest legal card in a reveal-and-choose,
   everything matching in an any-number search, and `default_sacrifice_pick`'s
   "keep the one whose death loses the game for last, then take the smallest". A
   card that should choose otherwise needs a valuation, not a branch.
9. **A picker's enumeration is a hint; the engine re-checks the answer.** A
   client offering a whole library or hand would otherwise turn "a creature card
   with mana value 6 or greater" into Demonic Tutor (round 11), or an
   additional cost into nothing (rounds 38, 50).
10. **A cost is not a target** (CR 601.2b vs 601.2c) — two announcements, two
    fields, and a card can have both (Dwarven Weaponsmith). A cost payment is
    also not targeted, so protection, shroud and hexproof have nothing to say
    about what may pay (round 52).
11. **An index is not an identity.** On the battlefield that is `permanent_id`;
    in a hand, where two copies are literally one object, resolve the named
    index **to a card** before anything leaves the zone (round 50).
12. **Gates are all-of.** A modal card with a dead mode, a planeswalker with one
    unreadable ability, an Aura whose effect line is unimplemented, a permanent
    whose lines are all markers — refused naming the clause, rather than
    resolving the readable part.
13. **Obey a size guard rather than raising it.** `parser.py` at 1,000 lines
    (round 31) and the per-set test files (round 33) were both split instead;
    the guard is the signal that a family stopped absorbing new work.

## Round 80: a reveal that records, and the sentence that reads it

*(2026-08-17.)* M21 **229 → 230** — Track Down.

> Scry 3, then reveal the top card of your library. If it's a creature or land
> card, draw a card.

**The pool already had a reveal-top production, and reusing it would have been
wrong.** Garruk, Savage Herald's is one node for a whole three-sentence template
— "reveal … put it into your hand. Otherwise, put it on the bottom" — and its
docstring says why: the two destinations *are* the effect, and every word of them
is required. Track Down is the opposite decomposition: the reveal records what it
showed and what follows is an ordinary conditional. Generalising the Garruk node
would have made its own docstring untrue of half its cases, so this is a sibling
node reached by *falling back* — the three-sentence template is still checked
first and keeps every word it requires.

**Recording is the point, not an implementation detail.** CR 701.15: revealing
shows a card and moves it nowhere. The branch's own draw then changes what is on
top, so a condition that re-read the library would be asking about whichever card
the draw uncovered. The reveal writes the card into the resolution scratchpad and
the conditional reads that, with the producer discipline round 78 established: no
reveal in this effect, no lowering.

**Present tense is a different question from past tense.** Round 78's `ItWas`
asks what an object *was* before it left a zone (CR 608.2h); this asks what a card
sitting in a library *is*. Different producers, so a separate node rather than a
tense flag on one.

**And the near-miss I walked straight into.** "it's" is not unambiguous the way
"it was" is: Giant Tortoise prints "This creature gets +0/+3 **as long as it's
untapped**", and my first cut swallowed it, turning a working card unsupported.
The branch now takes a sentence only when a noun phrase naming card *types*
follows, and hands it back otherwise. The suite caught it immediately — that test
existed — which is the argument for running the whole thing rather than the file
you are editing.

Suite green, every `--check` gate green, shipped pool 388/388, AI simulation
byte-identical at 443 interactions, **zero hooks added**. Six new tests, five
watched to fail on the round-79 engine; the sixth is the Giant Tortoise control,
which passes on both and is the one that matters.

## Round 81: one counter, two amounts

*(2026-08-17.)* M21 **230 → 231** — Lofty Denial.

> Counter target spell unless its controller pays {1}. If you control a creature
> with flying, counter that spell unless its controller pays {4} instead.

**Everything this card needs already existed except the fusing.** The counter
flow takes an `unless_pays_amount`; round 72's `controls` condition payload
already expresses "you control a creature with flying", `with_keywords` and all.
What was missing is that the two sentences are **one counter**: lowered as two
steps the card counters twice and asks its victim to pay twice, which is a
different and much worse card.

So the second sentence adds no effect — it replaces a number in the first — and
the fuser emits the single instruction the first sentence describes with the
replacement riding beside the printed amount.

**The word "instead" is load-bearing and is therefore recorded, not consumed.**
It is the whole difference between a replacement amount and a second counter, so
it is required on the bound form ("counter **that spell** … instead") and refused
on a freshly chosen one, where there is no earlier amount to replace. Both
refusals are tested; neither costs a pool card.

**The condition is asked by the handler, at resolution.** CR 608.2 puts the
question there, and the card means it: a flier that dies in response to Lofty
Denial drops the demand from {4} back to {1}. Lowering it into two branches would
have fixed the number when the spell was cast. Measured all three ways.

"That spell" gets its own quantifier for the reason round 75's "those creatures"
did: a bound reference and a chosen one reach different machinery, and every
lowering refuses "that" unless it says otherwise, so a sentence reaching one
fails by name rather than failing to parse.

Suite green, every `--check` gate green, shipped pool 388/388, AI simulation
byte-identical at 443 interactions, **zero hooks added**. Six new tests, four
watched to fail on the round-80 engine; the other two are the refusal controls,
which pass on both because the line refused for a different reason before.

## Round 82: a blanket prevention narrowed to a printed noun phrase

*(2026-08-17.)* M21 **231 → 232** — Pack Leader.

> Whenever this creature attacks, prevent all combat damage that would be dealt
> this turn to Dogs you control.

**A turn-wide record, not a shield per Dog** — and that is the whole design
decision. `engine/shields.py` hands a `Shield` to a *recipient*, which fixes the
set at resolution. "Dogs you control" is not fixed: CR 611.2c fixes an effect's
set only where the effect says so, and this one says a phrase. So a Dog that
enters **after** the trigger resolves is protected too, and a shield handed to
each Dog present would have been a strictly narrower card than the one printed.
That case is a test, and it is the one that decides the shape.

The record therefore sits beside the existing blanket flag, with the same
lifetime and cleared in the same two places, and the interceptor re-matches the
phrase when damage would be dealt. Its ordering constant sits next to the
unscoped blanket's for the reason that file already gives: neither has charges,
so applying one costs its recipient nothing and neither can be spent on damage
that was never going to be dealt.

**The refusal it replaces stays for everything else.** "…dealt this turn to you"
is a shield on one recipient and still refuses — the record covers whoever
*matches*, which is a different thing from whoever was named.

**And a word-order fix that is not cosmetic.** The production read the recipient
only *before* the duration; Pack Leader prints it after. Both orders are the same
sentence, so the recipient is now read on either side rather than the card
failing on where the words sit.

Measured five ways: the controller's Dog and a Dog that arrived later are both
prevented; a non-Dog, an opponent's Dog, and noncombat damage all go through.

Suite green, every `--check` gate green, shipped pool 388/388, AI simulation
byte-identical at 443 interactions, **zero hooks added**. Seven new tests, six
watched to fail on the round-81 engine. One of them pins round 73's "other" fix
on this card's lord line, so a later change to one half cannot quietly undo the
other.
